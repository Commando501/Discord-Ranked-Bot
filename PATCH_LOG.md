## Technical Debt & Improvement Areas

### High Priority
1. Error Handling
   - Need consistent error handling across services
   - Should implement proper error classes

2. Database Operations
   - Transaction support needed for critical operations
   - Connection pooling optimization required

### Medium Priority
1. Code Organization
   - Service layer needs better separation of concerns
   - Command handlers could be modularized further

2. Testing
   - Unit tests missing for core services
   - Integration tests needed for Discord commands

### Low Priority
1. Documentation
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Configuration options need better documentation

## File Structure & Functions

### Server Components
- `server/index.bot.ts`: Main bot initialization and event handling
- `server/storage.ts`: Database operations implementation
