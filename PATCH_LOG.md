   - Service layer needs better separation of concerns
   - Command handlers could be modularized further

2. Testing
   - Unit tests missing for core services
   - Integration tests needed for Discord commands

### Low Priority
1. Documentation
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Configuration options need better documentation
