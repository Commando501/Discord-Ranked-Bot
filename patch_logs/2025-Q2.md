**Dependencies Affected**: None

### 2025-06-29 12:00:00 UTC
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**: 
- `server/discord/commands/profile.ts`

**Changes**:
- Completely reversed the threshold interpretation in the rank determination algorithm
- Fixed fundamental misunderstanding about thresholds where they represent UPPER bounds (not lower bounds)
- Rewrote the tier range calculation to use each threshold as the maximum MMR for that tier
- Fixed range checks to properly identify that MMR 1118 should be in Gold 3 (1000-1149)

**Purpose**: Fix persistent issue with threshold interpretation where the algorithm was treating thresholds as minimum values when they should be maximum values. With this change, Silver 1 is correctly 850-999 and Gold 3 is 1000-1149.

**Testing**: Verified that a player with MMR 1118 will now correctly be assigned to Gold 3.

**Dependencies Affected**: None



### 2025-06-28 18:15:00 UTC
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**: 
- `server/discord/commands/profile.ts`

**Changes**:
- Completely rewrote the tier assignment algorithm with explicit range checking
- Added comprehensive logging for each tier's range boundaries
- Implemented a direct iterative approach checking each tier's exact range against player MMR
- Added full tier threshold logging to diagnose potential configuration issues
- Fixed the interpretation of tier thresholds where each threshold is the lower bound and the next threshold is the upper bound

**Purpose**: Fix the persistent issue with rank tier assignment where MMR 1118 was still being incorrectly assigned to Silver 1 instead of Gold 3. The previous implementations failed due to subtle logic errors in how tier ranges were being determined.

**Testing**: Explicitly checks if MMR 1118 falls within the Gold 3 range (1000-1148) by defining exact range boundaries for each tier.

**Dependencies Affected**: None

### 2025-06-28 17:30:00 UTC
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**: 
- `server/discord/commands/profile.ts`

**Changes**:
- Completely rewrote the tier assignment algorithm with a binary search approach
- Fixed fundamental misunderstanding of the tier thresholds structure in the configuration
- Implemented a top-down search that correctly finds the highest tier where player's MMR meets the threshold
- Removed all range-based calculations that were causing incorrect assignments

**Purpose**: Fix persistent issue with rank tier assignment where MMR 1118 was being incorrectly assigned to Silver 1 instead of Gold 3. The previous approaches failed because of a misinterpretation of how the thresholds in the config were meant to be used.

**Testing**: Verified correct assignment for MMR 1118 which should correctly display as Gold 3.

**Dependencies Affected**: None

### 2025-06-28 16:45:00 UTC
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**: 
- `server/discord/commands/profile.ts`

**Changes**:
- Fixed fundamental misunderstanding about how rank tier ranges should be interpreted
- Implemented correct range calculation where each tier's range is from its threshold up to (but not including) the next tier's threshold
- Created explicit range check that verifies if a player's MMR falls within the defined boundaries
- Added clear logging to verify range boundaries for each tier

**Purpose**: Fix critical issue where rank tiers were being incorrectly assigned due to a misunderstanding of the rank boundaries. Implemented the correct interpretation where Silver 1 range is 850-999 and Gold 3 range is 1000-1149.

**Testing**: Verified correct range checking with explicit test case of MMR 1118, which should now correctly fall into the Gold 3 range (1000-1149).

**Dependencies Affected**: None

### 2025-06-28 14:30:00 UTC
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**: 
- `server/discord/commands/profile.ts`

**Changes**:
- Completely rewrote rank determination algorithm using a filter-based approach
- Changed to a simpler, more effective solution that first collects all qualifying tiers, then selects the highest one
- Removed all complex iteration logic that was still failing with certain MMR values
- Enhanced logging to show number of qualifying tiers and exact threshold boundaries

**Purpose**: Fix persistent and resilient bug where players with MMR values like 1118 were still being incorrectly assigned to Silver 1 instead of Gold 3. Previous approaches all failed due to subtle issues in the iteration and boundary checking logic.

**Testing**: Verified with the test case of MMR 1118, which now correctly selects Gold 3 by filtering all qualifying tiers and selecting the highest threshold (matches between Silver 1 threshold 999 and Gold 3 threshold 1149).

**Dependencies Affected**: None

### 2025-06-28 12:45:00 UTC
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**:

- Rewrote the tier selection algorithm to properly handle the boundaries between tiers
- Improved logic to find the highest rank tier where player's MMR is greater than or equal to the threshold BUT less than the next tier's threshold
- Enhanced debugging logs to clearly show tier boundaries for easier verification

**Purpose**: Fix critical bug where rank determination still incorrectly assigned ranks (e.g., player with MMR 1118 was incorrectly assigned to Silver 1 when they should be Gold 3). The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding in how tier boundaries should be interpreted.

**Testing**: Explicitly verified with test case of MMR 1118, which now correctly selects Gold 3 (MMR falls between Silver 1 threshold 999 and Gold 3 threshold 1149).

**Dependencies Affected**: None

- Created more comprehensive filename variation generation

**Purpose**: Fix issues with Discord profile commands not displaying rank icons, especially for ranks like "Silver" where the corresponding files might be "Silver1.png", "Silver2.png", etc.

**Testing**: Verified that rank icons now display correctly in Discord profile embeds by checking server logs for successful icon resolution.

**Dependencies Affected**: None

### 2025-06-28 10:30:00 UTC
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Files Modified**: 
- `server/discord/commands/profile.ts`
