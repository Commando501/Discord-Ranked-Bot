- server/discord/commands/leaderboard.ts

### Changes:
- Fixed the `/leaderboard` command by replacing non-existent `listAllPlayers()` method with available `listTopPlayers(limit)` method
- Set a high limit (1000) to ensure all players are retrieved for accurate leaderboard display
- The command now properly retrieves players ranked by MMR for display in the leaderboard

### Testing:
- Verified the command no longer throws "TypeError: storage.listAllPlayers is not a function" and properly displays the leaderboard with pagination.
